# [Project 1: Voting Trend: Project Overview](https://github.com/HoaTran2003/Project-_1_Voting_Trend)
* Scraped election data from https://clerk.house.gov/cgi-bin/ to know about the polarization of voting behaviors of  the US House chamber.
* Created a program to investigate whether a roll call number (of a policy/law) is party line vote or not by user's input. 
* Used matplotlib to plot fraction of party line votes from 1999 to 2020.

# [Project 2: The magic of polling](https://github.com/HoaTran2003/Project_2_Polling_Results_Analysis)
The main goal of this project is to investigate whether a small poll sample will affect the outcoming result when considering the bigger picture. That is to say that this also helps to find out how reliably large a poll sample must be in able to represent an entire population. The reason behind for this is there are many confounding factors that can influence a pollâ€™s result, meaning that it is much harder to apply the results of a sample to an entire population. Moreover, the aforementioned problem also includes the idea of random sampling and margin of error which serves as a basic introduction to data analytics. With this, one will have more experience and a more holistic perspective in how to utilize computational problem solving with data analytics.
