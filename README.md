# [Project 1: Voting Trend: Project Overview](https://github.com/HoaTran2003/Project-_1_Voting_Trend)
* Scraped election data from https://clerk.house.gov/cgi-bin/ to know about the polarization of voting behaviors of  the US House chamber.
* Created a program to investigate whether a roll call number (of a policy/law) is party line vote or not by user's input. 
* Used matplotlib to plot fraction of party line votes from 1999 to 2020.

# [Project 2: The magic of polling](https://github.com/HoaTran2003/Project_2_Polling_Results_Analysis)
The main goal of this project is to investigate whether a small poll sample will affect the outcoming result when considering the bigger picture. That is to say that this also helps to find out how reliably large a poll sample must be in able to represent an entire population. The reason behind for this is there are many confounding factors that can influence a poll’s result, meaning that it is much harder to apply the results of a sample to an entire population. Moreover, the aforementioned problem also includes the idea of random sampling and margin of error which serves as a basic introduction to data analytics. With this, one will have more experience and a more holistic perspective in how to utilize computational problem solving with data analytics. 

# [Project 3: SAT Scores Linear Regression](https://github.com/HoaTran2003/Project_3_Sat_Scores) 
This project aims to investigate whether SAT scores (MATH & VERBAL individually and cumulatively) as well as high school GPA are good predictors of college’s GPA. With that in mind, the resulting analysis will certainly help us to have a better understanding of how admission officers  weigh their options based on academic achievements. 

# [Project 4: Market penetration (Implementation of Bass Fusion Model)](https://github.com/HoaTran2003/Project_4_Market_Pen) 
The main goal of this project is to simulate how a product is adopted over time by using the difference equation called the Bass fusion model. It presents a rationale of how current adopters and potential adopters of a new product interact as seen through the calculations required of the model. This is basically how new customers accustomed to new product and technologies. The reason this is intriguing is that by successfully understanding and analyzing the results, we will be able to utilize it in a broader context such as forecasting product’s sales as well as technology. 

# [Project 5: Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/HoaTran2003/Project_5_Twitter/blob/main/README.md)
With the rapid changes of the Covid-19 pandemic, people’s perspective of it has always been drastically different. Most notably, such a drastic difference can be seen on many social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Because of this, analysis of the sentiment value of social media , especially Twitter’s tweets, will be of crucial importance in understanding how the public is viewing the pandemic. 

#[Project 6: Airbnb analysis](https://github.com/HoaTran2003/Project_6_Airbnb_Analysis)
In this project, we will explore factors that affect the price of rental units in Columbus, Ohio. We will examine characteristics of the rentals, geographic locations, and time considerations. This will serve both a descriptive and a predictive analytics purpose: descriptive in the sense that interpreting regression models can help us understand what factors are the most critical to the price and how they affect it; and predictive in estimating what the price of a rental is, given certain factors that could be measured. Predictions can be used from both the renter and owner perspective: renters can understand whether a property is fairly priced and identify good deals, and owners can receive suggestions about how to price their properties.
