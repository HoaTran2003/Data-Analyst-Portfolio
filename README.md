# Project 1: Voting Trend: Project Overview
* Scraped election data from https://clerk.house.gov/cgi-bin/ to know about the polarization of voting behaviors of  the US House chamber.
* Created a program to investigate whether a roll call number (of a policy/law) is party line vote or not by user's input. 
* Used matplotlib to plot fraction of party line votes from 1999 to 2020.
